# Calculate the sum of squares of given numbers in integer, excluding any negetive values

- the first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100). indicating the number of test cases to follow.
- Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer x (o < x <- 100 ), followed by another line
  consisting of x number of space-separated integers n (100 <= Yn <= 100 ).
- For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers, excluding any negatives, and print the
  calculated sum in the output.

- Note 1: There should be no output until all the inpuf has been received.
- Note 2: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
- Note 3: Take input from any method ( or an imaginary one in case of pseudo code )
